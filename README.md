# ALWeb-Dev-Proj
Austin Lane Tech. Web Developer test project.

## Description
The goal of this project is to be able to create a list of users and display a table with the already existing users.

## Getting started
- Create a new branch off of `Main`
  - Name it `<your name>-ALTest`
- As you code this project, ensure you push your changes often!

## Requirements
- Each user data object should be represented by the `User` class found in `index.js`. Since this class accepts three
parameters, your table needs to have the three respective columns.
- In terms of CRUD operations, users can be created or deleted. Do not worry about editing existing data.
- Since you will not create a database, your list of users will be kept in memory (i.e. array) and should match what is on the screen.

## Tech Requirements
- All your javascript needs to be contained in `index.js`, and css in `index.css`.
- Your do not have to use any specific javascript library or framework
- You will be required to explain your code.

**GOOD LUCK**
